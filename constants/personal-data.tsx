    Hey there‚úåüèª I&#39;m <b>Gowthamaan @ GV</b>, a MS student at IIT Madras
    specializing in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Fueled by my OCD, I
    prioritize details, reveling in the creation of functional and user-centered
    digital experiences. Besides my software and research work, I also teach
    Flutter and Machine Learning to college students and working folks. I enjoy
    making complicated things simple so that others can learn quickly. In my
    free time, I work on real-time projects to improve my skillsets.
